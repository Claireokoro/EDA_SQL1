<h1 style="color:red">Exploratory Data Analysis with SQLite</h1>

Programming languages like Python or R, which provide a large selection of libraries and tools especially made for data analysis, are frequently used for exploratory data analysis (EDA). Although SQL is frequently used for database management and querying, EDA is not typically conducted using SQL as the tool of choice. You may still use SQL to run some simple exploratory analysis on your data though. An overview of how to use SQL for EDA is given below:
- You start by connecting to the database: Establish a connection to the database using appropriate credentials and client software.
- Understand the data structure: Familiarize yourself with the tables, columns, and relationships in the database by querying the schema.
- Sample the data: Retrieve a small sample of the data using the SELECT statement with appropriate filters or random sampling techniques.
- Summarize the data: Utilize SQL's aggregate functions like <b>COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX </b>to calculate basic statistics on numerical columns.
- Analyze data distributions: Use SQL queries with grouping and aggregation techniques to calculate frequencies or proportions of categorical variables and percentiles or summary statistics for numerical columns.
- Filter and sort data: Use the WHERE clause to filter the data based on specific conditions and the ORDER BY clause to sort the data, enabling the identification of patterns or outliers.
- Join and merge tables: If the data is distributed across multiple tables, perform joins to combine relevant information, gaining a comprehensive view of the data.
- Export and visualize results: Export the results of SQL queries and utilize external tools like Python or R to create visualizations, allowing for deeper insights and identification of patterns.


It is advised to use specialized data analysis languages like Python or R, which offer more complete libraries for thorough EDA, even though SQL has basic analysis capabilities.
